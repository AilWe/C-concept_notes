/* Constructor in C++
 *  A member function of a class to initialize objects of a class
 *  Automatically called when object create.
 *  Constructor has same name as the class itself
 *  Constructor don't have return type
 *  If not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generate a default constructor
 *  Three types of constructor
 *      1) Default constructor: does not take any argument. It has no parameters
     *       construct()
             {
                a = 10;
                b = 20;
             }
            If we define our own constructor, compiler does not create the default constructor.
        2) Parameterized constructor: pass argument to constructor
            It is used to initialize the various data elements of different object with different value when they are created
            It is used to overload constructor
            Point(int x1, int y1)
            {
                x = x1;
                y = y1;
            }
        3) Copy constructor: A member function initializes an object using another object of the same class
     *
 */
/* Copy constructor
 *  A member function initializes an object using another object of the same class
 *      ClassName (const ClassName &old_obj);
 *      Point(const Point &p2) {x = p2.x; y = p2.y; }
 *      When an object of the class is returned by value.
 *      When an object of the class is passed to a function by value as an argument
 *      When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class
 *      When the compiler generates a temporary object
 *      If we don't define our own copy constructor, the C++ compiler creates a default copy constructor for each class
 *      which does a member-wise copy between objects.
 *      We need to define our own copy constructor only if an object has pointers or any runtime allocation of the resource
 *      like file handle, a network connection
 *      Deep copy is possible only with user defined copy constructor.
 *          In user defined copy constructor, we make sure that pointers or references of copied object point to new memory locations.
 *      Copy constructor vs assignment operator
 *          Copy constructor: My class t3 = t1; It called when a new object is created from an existing object, as a copy of the existing object.
 *          Assignment operator: My class t1, t2; t2 = t1; It is called when an already initialized object is assigned a new value from another existing object.

    Why argument to a copy constructor must be passed as a reference?
     A copy constructor is called when an object is passed by value.

/* Destructors in C++
 *  A member function destructs or delete an object
 *  A destructor is called automatically when the object goes out of scope
 *      1) the function ends
 *      2) the program ends
 *      3) a block containing local variables end
 *      4) a delete operator is called
 *   ~className
 *   Destructors do not take any argument and do not return anything
 *   There only one destructor in a class
 *   If we do not write our won destructor in class, compiler creates a default destructor for us.
 *   When we have dynamically allocated memory or pointer in class. When a class contains a pointer to memory allocated in class,
 *   we should write a destructor to release memory before the class instance is destroyed--> to avoid memory leak.
 *   It is good idea to make destructors virtual in base class when we have a virtual function.
 */
/* WHen should we write our own copy constructor
 *  C++ compiler provide default copy constructor (and assignment operator) with class
 *  When we have members with dynamically gets initialized at run time, default copy constructor copies this members with
 *  address of dynamically allocated memory and not real copy of this memory.
 *  Now both the objects points to the same memory and changes in one reflects in another object
 *  When we delete one of this object, other object still points to same memory will be dangling pointer--> memory leak
 */
/* When is copy constructor called
 *  1) When an object of the class is returned by value
 *  2) When an object of the class is passed to a function by value as argument
 *  3) When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class
 *  4) When compiler generates a temporary object
