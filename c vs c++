/* C vs C++
 * In c++, compiler error to call a function before declare, but in C, it works.
 * In C++, compiler error to make a normal pointer to point a const variable, it is allowed in C.
 * In C, a void pointer can be assigned to other pointer like int *, char *. In C++, it ia not allowed, typcasted needed.
 *  eg. int *p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int))
 * In C++, const variable must be initialized, in C it isn't necessary.
 * C can use keyword as variable name
 * C++ does more strict type checking than C
 *  eg. char *c = 333 // invalid conversion from 'int' to 'char *'
 * No void return allowed for main()
 *
